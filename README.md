# Currency Denomination Challenge

This project is a web-based user interface for a coding challenge solution related to currency exchange problems. It provides two interactive tabs that let users explore two distinct challenges:

- **Smallest Unreachable:** Determine the smallest amount that cannot be achieved using at most one bill of each denomination.
- **Minimum Bills:** Calculate the minimum number of bills needed to provide exact change given a price and a payment. This solution employs a recursive algorithm with memoization to handle arbitrary denominations.

## Features

- **Navigation Tabs:**  
  - **Smallest Unreachable:** Users can manually enter or randomly generate bill denominations, then calculate the smallest unreachable amount.
  - **Minimum Bills:** Users can manually enter or randomly generate denominations, price, and payment values, then compute the minimum number of bills needed for exact change.
  
- **User Input & Random Generation:**  
  - Input fields allow custom entries.
  - Buttons provide random generation of denominations, price, and payment.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  - Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the UI is fully responsive for both desktop and mobile devices.
  
- **Optimized Algorithms:**  
  - Uses a greedy approach for calculating the smallest unreachable amount.
  - Implements a recursive solution with memoization for determining the minimum number of bills.

- **Simulated API:**  
  - A simulated API mimics real API calls to retrieve bill denominations, price, and payment values, seamlessly integrating with the challenge logic.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thejessicafelts/currency-denomination-challenge.git
   cd currency-denomination-challenge
   ```

2. **Open the Project**

   - Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser (no server setup required).

3. **Using the Smallest Unreachable Tab**

   - **Manual Input:**
     - Enter a comma-separated list of bill denominations (e.g., `1,2,5`) into the provided input field.
     - Click "Set Denominations" to update the list.
   - **Random Generation:**
     - Click "Randomly Generate Denominations" to auto-populate the field.
   - Click "Find Smallest Unreachable" to calculate and display the result.

4. **Using the Minimum Bills Tab**

   - **Manual Input:**
     - Enter a comma-separated list of bill denominations (e.g., `1,5,10`) in the input field.
     - Enter a price and payment value in the respective fields.
     - Click "Set Denominations" and "Set Price & Payment" to update the values.
   - **Random Generation:**
     - Click "Randomly Generate Denominations" and "Randomly Generate Price & Payment" to auto-fill the fields.
   - Click "Calculate Minimum Bills" to compute and display the minimum number of bills required for the exact change.
     - The program returns `-1` if exact change is not possible, and `0` if no change is required.

## Technical Details

### Smallest Unreachable Calculation

Smallest Unreachable Calculation uses a greedy algorithm that:
1. Sorts the denominations in ascending order.
2. Iteratively adds each billâ€™s value to the range of reachable sums.
3. Returns the first gap where the current denomination exceeds the running total.

### Minimum Bills Calculation

Minimum Bills Calculation uses a recursive algorithm with memoization that:
1. Calculates the change (payment minus price).
2. Returns `-1` if payment is less than price or `0` if no change is needed.
3. Recursively computes the minimum number of bills required while optimizing repeated subproblems via memoization.
4. Returns the minimum number of bills or `-1` if exact change cannot be made.
